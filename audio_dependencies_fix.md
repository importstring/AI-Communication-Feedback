# Audio Processing Dependencies Fix

## Issues Fixed

1. **librosa-numpy compatibility**: Updated numpy from 1.22.0 to 1.23.5 to be compatible with librosa 0.10.1

2. **scipy version issue**: Downgraded scipy from 1.12.0 to 1.10.1 to fix the error `ImportError: cannot import name 'ifft' from 'scipy'`

   - In newer scipy versions, `fft` and `ifft` were moved to the `scipy.fft` submodule
   - Some dependencies like disvoice were still importing directly from scipy

3. **torchaudio compatibility**: Added torchaudio 2.2.1 to match the torch 2.2.1 version

   - Fixed symbol loading errors in the C++ extensions

4. **tokenizers compatibility**: Ensured tokenizers 0.13.3 works with transformers 4.30.2

## Current Working State

- Basic librosa functionality is confirmed working:
  - Pitch extraction with YIN algorithm
  - MFCC feature extraction
  - Audio processing pipeline

## Remaining Issues

There are still some dependency conflicts that may need to be addressed:

1. TTS package has various dependency conflicts
2. Some dependencies (crepe) have unmet requirements:
   - hmmlearn, imageio, resampy
3. Transformers/Keras integration issues remain

## Usage Notes

- The `tonation.py` module should now be able to correctly use librosa for audio analysis
- The emotions detection module may still have issues with the transformers dependency
- For complete test coverage, additional dependencies would need to be fixed
